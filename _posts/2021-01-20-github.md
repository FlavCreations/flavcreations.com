I have a Git Hub full of projects I am working on, previously worked on, or finished. You can find it here: [Repositories](https://github.com/Flavius-The-Person?tab=repositories). This is where I put most of my viewable repositories. Whether it was LSL, Java, C#, or various other projects, most of them are here.
